# Narato.ResponseMiddleware.Models
This library contains the core models for use in the narato stack

When using the Narato.Libraries stack, be sure to use [these Exceptions](https://github.com/Narato/Narato.ResponseMiddleware.Models/tree/master/src/Narato.ResponseMiddleware.Models/Exceptions). The exceptionmapping relies on those.

Other than that, when working with pagination, please use the [Paged](https://github.com/Narato/Narato.ResponseMiddleware.Models/blob/master/src/Narato.ResponseMiddleware.Models/Models/Paged.cs) model.
